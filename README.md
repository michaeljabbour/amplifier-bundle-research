# amplifier-bundle-research

**Superpowers for scientific rigor — for anyone who needs a defensible written artifact.**

Patent briefs, policy positions, white papers, literature reviews, workshop papers, grant applications, full journal articles. Same discipline, same scaffolding — output shaped to the venue.

---

## Install

```bash
amplifier bundle add --app git+https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-bundle-research@main
amplifier bundle use research
amplifier
```

No YAML edits and no API keys beyond the one Amplifier already uses.

## Why it exists

Scientific rigor is a set of habits: ask a precise question, lock the method before you see the data, report honestly against yourself, cite properly, and format for the reader. Working researchers learn these over a decade; everyone else reinvents the mistakes.

This bundle encodes the habits. A patent attorney, a policy analyst, a founder drafting a technical white paper, or a first-time researcher all get the same scaffolding and the same honest critic — shaped to what they are making.

## How you use it

A six-step pipeline, available as slash commands. The `research-coordinator` also routes natural-language requests to the right step.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/question` | Sharpen a vague idea into a precise, defensible claim. |
| `/study-plan` | Lock the methodology *before* results exist — writes a hash-sealed pre-registration. |
| `/execute` | Run the analysis, gather prior art, or pull the evidence. |
| `/critique` | An honest peer reviewer: names limitations, flags overclaiming, separates confirmatory from exploratory. |
| `/draft` | Produce the artifact in the right structure for the audience. |
| `/publish` | Format for the target venue (LaTeX / DOCX / brief). Gated until critique has run and any honest-pivots are acknowledged. |

### Or jump straight to a document type

```bash
amplifier run "Run the patent-brief recipe on: Novel rolling-ROI control for AI agent sessions"
amplifier run "Run the white-paper recipe on: Return on Inference — when model spend pays back"
amplifier run "Run the empirical-paper recipe on: Reflection tokens improve long-horizon reasoning"
```

Document recipes: **patent-brief, policy-brief, white-paper, empirical-paper, benchmark-paper, replication-study, grant-proposal, literature-review, idea-generation, paperbanana-figure.**

### Just want to write a paper?

If you want the paper-authoring slice only — LaTeX, conference formatting, citations, and figures, without the pre-registration and experiment machinery — use the bundled lean variant:

```bash
amplifier bundle add ./bundles/paper-only.md
amplifier run --bundle research-paper-only "Draft a NeurIPS paper on ..."
```

(This absorbs the former `amplifier-bundle-scientificpaper`, which was a strict subset of this bundle and is now retired.)

## What's inside

| Component | Count | Highlights |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Specialist agents** | 14 | hypothesis-designer, methodologist, preregistration-reviewer, statistician, literature-scout, idea-generator, honest-critic, ml-paper-reviewer, research-paper-architect, research-technical-writer, research-citation-manager, venue-formatter, figure-designer, research-coordinator |
| **Runtime modes** | 6 | the `/question → /publish` pipeline, registered as slash commands |
| **Document recipes** | 10 | one per artifact type, end-to-end |
| **Discipline behaviors** | 12 | honest-pivot, exploratory-labeling, stop-slop, cross-vendor-judge, cache-only-verification, plus the paper-authoring composite |
| **Experiment-integrity tools** | 6 | audit, power analysis, provenance check, resume/repair, stage analysis, hypothesis blocking |
| **Figure generation** | 1 | PaperBanana multi-agent pipeline with 8 quality veto rules (`modules/tool-paperbanana`) |
| **Venue knowledge** | 9 | NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, IEEE, ACM, arXiv + USPTO patent, policy memo, NSF/NIH grant |

Plus a reproducibility stack (`environment.yml`, `Dockerfile.research`, execution/evidence-log schemas), LaTeX templates and skeletons, and utility scripts for compilation, validation, and figure generation.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-bundle-research.git
cd amplifier-bundle-research

# Standalone dev composition (adds a provider so it runs without --app)
amplifier run --bundle ./bundles/dev.yaml "your prompt here"
```

See [`bundles/dev.yaml`](bundles/dev.yaml) and [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) for the full workflow.
